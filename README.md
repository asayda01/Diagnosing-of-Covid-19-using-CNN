# Diagnosing of Covid-19 using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on Human Chest X-Ray Films
"Diagnosing of Covid-19 using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on Chest X-Ray Films"
Mankind, who has been struggling with epidemic diseases for long years, had to take precautions in a global scale that was not seen before due to an epidemic in China. 
While this epidemic was spreading faster than the humanity had thought, the traditional test methods were found to be inadequate for the diagnosis of the cause of the epidemic which is coronavirus. 
Indeed, using an immediate diagnosing method which might be a machine learning model can be used for minimizing the burden on both of medical workers and healthcare system in the event of the epidemic.
Therefore, this project aims to create and develop a machine learning model consisting of a convolutional neural network to diagnose the coronavirus disease by looking only at human chest x-ray images.
Because a powerful convolutional neural network-based machine learning model requires a large number of samples and it can be difficult to find sufficient medical data samples during outbreaks, 
the model in this study achieved only 96.52% accuracy over the six different data sets.
